There were pears and apples clustered high in blooming\npyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers'\nbenevolence, to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people's mouths might\nwater gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and\nbrown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and\npleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were\nNorfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the\noranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy\npersons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper\nbags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth\namong these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\nstagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going\non; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in\nslow and passionless excitement.\n\nThe Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters\ndown, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone\nthat the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that\nthe twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters\nwere rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended\nscents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the\nraisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the\nsticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious,\nthe candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the\ncoldest lookers-on feel faint, and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that\nthe figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in\nmodest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything\nwas good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all\nso hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they\ntumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets\nwildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running\nback to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the\nbest humour possible; while the grocer and his people were so frank and\nfresh, that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons\nbehind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection,\nand for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.\n\nBut soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel, and\naway they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes and\nwith their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged, from scores\nof by-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people,\ncarrying their dinners to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor\nrevellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with\nScrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and, taking off the covers as\ntheir bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch.\nAnd it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice, when there\nwere angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each\nother, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their\ngood-humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to\nquarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!\n\nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was\na genial shadowing forth of all these dinners, and the progress of their\ncooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker's oven, where the\npavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.\n\n'Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?'\nasked Scrooge.\n\n'There is. My own.'\n\n'Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'To any kindly given. To a poor one most.'\n\n'Why to a poor one most?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'Because it needs it most.'\n\n'Spirit!' said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, 'I wonder you, of all\nthe beings in the many worlds about\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPANISH ONIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling Spanish onions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPANISH FRIARS<|>PERSON<|>Group of people associated with the Spanish onions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIRLS<|>PERSON<|>Individuals passing by the Spanish onions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISTLETOE<|>EVENT<|>Event involving the mistletoe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEARS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling pears)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling apples)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling grapes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHOPKEEPERS<|>PERSON<|>Individuals selling fruits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORFOLK BIFFINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling Norfolk Biffins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling oranges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling lemons)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling fish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROCERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling groceries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling tea)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COFFEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling coffee)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAISINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling raisins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMONDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling almonds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINNAMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling cinnamon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling spices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANDIED FRUITS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling candied fruits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling figs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH PLUMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Organization selling French plums)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPIRIT<|>PERSON<|>Mysterious figure sprinkling incense on dinners)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCROOGE<|>PERSON<|>Individual observing the Spirit)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPANISH ONIONS<|>SPANISH FRIARS<|>Spanish onions are associated with Spanish friars<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPANISH ONIONS<|>GIRLS<|>Girls passing by the Spanish onions<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPANISH ONIONS<|>MISTLETOE<|>Spanish onions are related to the event involving mistletoe<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEARS<|>APPLES<|>Pears and apples are both sold in the same shop<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEARS<|>GRAPES<|>Pears and grapes are sold in the same shop<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEARS<|>SHOPKEEPERS<|>Pears are sold by shopkeepers<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLES<|>GRAPES<|>Apples and grapes are sold in the same shop<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLES<|>SHOPKEEPERS<|>Apples are sold by shopkeepers<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPES<|>SHOPKEEPERS<|>Grapes are sold by shopkeepers<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORFOLK BIFFINS<|>ORANGES<|>Norfolk Biffins and oranges are sold in the same shop<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORFOLK BIFFINS<|>LEMONS<|>Norfolk Biffins and lemons are sold in the same shop<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORFOLK BIFFINS<|>SHOPKEEPERS<|>Norfolk Biffins are sold by shopkeepers<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORANGES<|>LEMONS<|>Oranges and lemons are sold in the same shop<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORANGES<|>SHOPKEEPERS<|>Oranges are sold by shopkeepers<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMONS<|>SHOPKEEPERS<|>Lemons are sold by shopkeepers<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH<|>SHOPKEEPERS<|>Fish are sold by shopkeepers<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROCERS<|>TEA<|>Grocers sell tea<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROCERS<|>COFFEE<|>Grocers sell coffee<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROCERS<|>RAISINS<|>Grocers sell raisins<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROCERS<|>ALMONDS<|>Grocers sell almonds<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROCERS<|>CINNAMON<|>Grocers sell cinnamon<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROCERS<|>SPICES<|>Grocers sell spices<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROCERS<|>CANDIED FRUITS<|>Grocers sell candied fruits<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROCERS<|>FIGS<|>Grocers sell figs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROCERS<|>FRENCH PLUMS<|>Grocers sell French plums<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPIRIT<|>SCROOGE<|>Spirit is observed by Scrooge<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
