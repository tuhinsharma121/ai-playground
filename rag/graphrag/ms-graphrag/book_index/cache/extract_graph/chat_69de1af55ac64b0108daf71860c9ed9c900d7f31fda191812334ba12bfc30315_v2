Ebenezer! Dick!'\n\nScrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,\naccompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\n\n'Dick Wilkins, to be sure!' said Scrooge to the Ghost. 'Bless me, yes.\nThere he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear,\ndear!'\n\n'Yo ho, my boys!' said Fezziwig. 'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve,\nDick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,' cried old\nFezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, 'before a man can say Jack\nRobinson!'\n\nYou wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into\nthe street with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their\nplaces--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight,\nnine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like\nracehorses.\n\n'Hilli-ho!' cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with\nwonderful agility. 'Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room\nhere! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!'\n\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or\ncouldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in\na minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from\npublic life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps\nwere trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as\nsnug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to\nsee upon a winter's night.\n\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and\nmade an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came\nMrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss\nFezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose\nhearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the\nbusiness. In came the housemaid, with her cousin the baker. In came the\ncook with her brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy\nfrom over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his\nmaster; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one,\nwho was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all\ncame, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some\nawkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, any how and\nevery how. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round\nand back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and\nround in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always\nturning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again as soon\nas they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help\nthem! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\nhands to stop the dance, cried out, 'Well done!' and the fiddler plunged\nhis hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose.\nBut, scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again,\nthough there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been\ncarried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\nresolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\n\n\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and\nthere was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold\nRoast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were\nmince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came\nafter the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The\nsort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told\nit him!) struck up 'Sir Roger de Coverley.' Then old Fezziwig stood\nout to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff\npiece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of\npartners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would\ndance, and had no notion of walking.\n\nBut if they had been twice as many--ah! four times--old Fe\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_69de1af55ac64b0108daf71860c9ed9c900d7f31fda191812334ba12bfc30315_v2"}
