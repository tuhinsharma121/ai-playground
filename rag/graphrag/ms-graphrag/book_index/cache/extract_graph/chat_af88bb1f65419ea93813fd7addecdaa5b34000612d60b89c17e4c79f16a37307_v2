'The Spirits of all Three shall strive\nwithin me. O Jacob Marley! Heaven and the Christmas Time be praised for\nthis! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!'\n\nHe was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his\nbroken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing\nviolently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with\ntears.\n\n'They are not torn down,' cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains\nin his arms, 'They are not torn down, rings and all. They are here--I am\nhere--the shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled.\nThey will be. I know they will!'\n\nHis hands were busy with his garments all this time: turning them inside\nout, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making\nthem parties to every kind of extravagance.\n\n'I don't know what to do!' cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the\nsame breath, and making a perfect Laocoon of himself with his stockings.\n'I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as\na schoolboy, I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to\neverybody! A happy New Year to all the world! Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!'\n\nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there,\nperfectly winded.\n\n'There's the saucepan that the gruel was in!' cried Scrooge, starting\noff again, and going round the fireplace. 'There's the door by which the\nGhost of Jacob Marley entered! There's the corner where the Ghost of\nChristmas Present sat! There's the window where I saw the wandering\nSpirits! It's all right, it's all true, it all happened. Ha, ha, ha!'\n\nReally, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was\na splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long\nline of brilliant laughs!\n\n'I don't know what day of the month it is,' said Scrooge. 'I don't know\nhow long I have been among the Spirits. I don't know anything. I'm quite\na baby. Never mind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!\nHallo here!'\n\nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the\nlustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clash, hammer; ding, dong,\nbell! Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clash, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!\n\nRunning to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no\nmist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood\nto dance to; golden sunlight; heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry\nbells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!\n\n'What's to-day?' cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday\nclothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.\n\n'EH?' returned the boy with all his might of wonder.\n\n'What's to-day, my fine fellow?' said Scrooge.\n\n'To-day!' replied the boy. 'Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.'\n\n'It's Christmas Day!' said Scrooge to himself. 'I haven't missed it. The\nSpirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like.\nOf course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!'\n\n'Hallo!' returned the boy.\n\n'Do you know the poulterer's in the next street but one, at the corner?'\nScrooge inquired.\n\n'I should hope I did,' replied the lad.\n\n'An intelligent boy!' said Scrooge. 'A remarkable boy! Do you know\nwhether they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there?--Not\nthe little prize turkey: the big one?'\n\n'What! the one as big as me?' returned the boy.\n\n'What a delightful boy!' said Scrooge. 'It's a pleasure to talk to him.\nYes, my buck!'\n\n'It's hanging there now,' replied the boy.\n\n'Is it?' said Scrooge. 'Go and buy it.'\n\n'Walk-ER!' exclaimed the boy.\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell 'em to\nbring it here, that I may give them the directions where to take it.\nCome back with the man, and I'll give you a shilling.
