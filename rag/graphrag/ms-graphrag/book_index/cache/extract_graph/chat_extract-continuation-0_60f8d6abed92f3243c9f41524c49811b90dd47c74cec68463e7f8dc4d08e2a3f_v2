But this the Spirit said could not be done.\n\n'Here is a new game,' said Scrooge. 'One half-hour, Spirit, only one!'\n\nIt was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of\nsomething, and the rest must find out what, he only answering to their\nquestions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to\nwhich he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an\nanimal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\nanimal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes and\nlived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn't made a show\nof, and wasn't led by anybody, and didn't live in a menagerie, and was\nnever killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a\nbull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every\nfresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar\nof laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to\nget up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a\nsimilar state, cried out:\n\n'I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!'\n\n'What is it?' cried Fred.\n\n'It's your uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge.'\n\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though\nsome objected that the reply to 'Is it a bear?' ought to have been\n'Yes'; inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have\ndiverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had\nany tendency that way.\n\n'He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,' said Fred, 'and it\nwould be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled\nwine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, \"Uncle Scrooge!\"'\n\n'Well! Uncle Scrooge!' they cried.\n\n'A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!'\nsaid Scrooge's nephew. 'He wouldn't take it from me, but may he have it,\nnevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!'\n\nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that\nhe would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked\nthem in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the\nwhole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\nnephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\n\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but\nalways with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick-beds, and they\nwere cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by\nstruggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty,\nand it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and gaol, in misery's every\nrefuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast\nthe door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing and taught\nScrooge his precepts.\n\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts\nof this, because the Christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into\nthe space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that, while\nScrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older,\nclearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it\nuntil they left a children's Twelfth-Night party, when, looking at the\nSpirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair\nwas grey.\n\n'Are spirits' lives so short?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'My life upon this globe is very brief,' replied the Ghost. 'It ends\nto-night.'\n\n'To-night!' cried Scrooge.\n\n'To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.'\n\nThe chimes were ringing the three-quarters past eleven at that moment.\n\n'Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,' said Sc\n######################\nOutput:",
