Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'\nreturned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children's children, and another\ngeneration beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind\nupon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a\nvery old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined\nin the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got\nquite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank\nagain.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,\npassing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful\nrange of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the\nwater--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of\nthe wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the\nlonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as\nprofound as death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus\nengaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to\nScrooge to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a\nbright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his\nside, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n\n'Ha, ha!' laughed Scrooge's nephew. 'Ha, ha, ha!'\n\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2a8453e9cb67c4f6af15fc21214126a3e18a555ac0d62cf907bb1f40a4ca20f2_v2"}
