'And\nit comes to the same thing.'\n\n'I seek!' exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n'Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in\nthat of your family,' said Scrooge.\n\n'There are some upon this earth of yours,' returned the Spirit, 'who\nlay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride,\nill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as\nstrange to us, and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived.\nRemember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.'\n\nScrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had\nbeen before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality\nof the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that\nnotwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any\nplace with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as\ngracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could\nhave done in any lofty hall.\n\nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this\npower of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and\nhis sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's\nclerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his\nrobe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to\nbless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch. Think\nof that! Bob had but fifteen 'Bob' a week himself; he pocketed on\nSaturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of\nChristmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\n\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a\ntwice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a\ngoodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda\nCratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master\nPeter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting\nthe corners of his monstrous shirt-collar (Bob's private property,\nconferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day,) into his mouth,\nrejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his\nlinen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and\ngirl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt\nthe goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts\nof sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and\nexalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud,\nalthough his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow\npotatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out\nand peeled.\n\n'What has ever got your precious father, then?' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'And\nyour brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by\nhalf an hour!'\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' cried the two young Cratchits. 'Hurrah! There's\n_such_ a goose, Martha!'\n\n'Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!' said Mrs.\nCratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet\nfor her with officious zeal.\n\n'We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,' replied the girl, 'and\nhad to clear away this morning, mother!'\n\n'Well! never mind so long as you are come,' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'Sit ye\ndown before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!'\n\n'No, no! There's father coming,' cried the two young Cratchits, who were\neverywhere at once.
