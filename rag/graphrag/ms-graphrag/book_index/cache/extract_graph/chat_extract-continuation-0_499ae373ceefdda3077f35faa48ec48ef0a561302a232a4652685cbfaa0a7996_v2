He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help\nthinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good\ntemper, year after year, and saying, \"Uncle Scrooge, how are you?\" If it\nonly put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that's_\nsomething; and I think I shook him yesterday.'\n\nIt was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.\nBut being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed\nat, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their\nmerriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.\n\nAfter tea they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew\nwhat they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:\nespecially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and\nnever swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over\nit. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and played, among other\ntunes, a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle\nit in two minutes) which had been familiar to the child who fetched\nScrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost\nof Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things\nthat Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he softened more and more;\nand thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he\nmight have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with\nhis own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob\nMarley.\n\n\n\nBut they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After a while they\nplayed at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never\nbetter than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.\nStop! There was first a game at blind man's-buff. Of course there was.\nAnd I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes\nin his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and\nScrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The\nway he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on\nthe credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling\nover the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself\namongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew\nwhere the plump sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had\nfallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have\nmade a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an\naffront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in\nthe direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn't\nfair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in\nspite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,\nhe got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct\nwas the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his\npretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to\nassure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her\nfinger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No\ndoubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in\noffice, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.\n\nScrooge's niece was not one of the blind man's-buff party, but was made\ncomfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where\nthe Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the\nforfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the\nalphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very\ngreat, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters\nhollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.\nThere might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all\nplayed, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting, in the interest he\nhad in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he\nsometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed\nright, too; for the sharpest needle, best\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNCLE SCROOGE<|>PERSON<|>Uncle Scrooge is a character who is initially portrayed as a miserly and grumpy old man)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOPPER<|>PERSON<|>Topper is a character who is part of a musical family and can sing in the bass range)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCROOGE'S NIECE<|>PERSON<|>Scrooge's niece is a character who plays the harp and participates in games during Christmas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST<|>EVENT<|>The Ghost of Christmas Past is a supernatural entity that shows Scrooge his past)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACOB MARLEY<|>PERSON<|>Jacob Marley is a character who is mentioned as being buried by the sexton's spade)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNCLE SCROOGE<|>GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST<|>Uncle Scrooge is reminded of his past by the Ghost of Christmas Past<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOPPER<|>SCROOGE'S NIECE<|>Topper and Scrooge's niece are part of the same musical family<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE'S NIECE<|>GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST<|>Scrooge's niece plays a tune familiar to the child who was brought by the Ghost of Christmas Past<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE<|>GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST<|>Scrooge is shown his past by the Ghost of Christmas Past<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
