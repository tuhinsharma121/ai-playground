'And travelling all the time?'\n\n'The whole time,' said the Ghost. 'No rest, no peace. Incessant torture\nof remorse.'\n\n'You travel fast?' said Scrooge.\n\n\n'On the wings of the wind,' replied the Ghost.\n\n'You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,'\nsaid Scrooge.\n\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so\nhideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have\nbeen justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\n\n'Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,' cried the phantom, 'not to know\nthat ages of incessant labour, by immortal creatures, for this earth\nmust pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\nall developed! Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in\nits little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too\nshort for its vast means of usefulness! Not to know that no space of\nregret can make amends for one life's opportunities misused! Yet such\nwas I! Oh, such was I!'\n\n'But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,' faltered Scrooge,\nwho now began to apply this to himself.\n\n'Business!' cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. 'Mankind was my\nbusiness. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,\nforbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my\ntrade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my\nbusiness!'\n\nIt held up its chain at arm's-length, as if that were the cause of all\nits unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\n\n'At this time of the rolling year,' the spectre said, 'I suffer most.\nWhy did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down,\nand never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a\npoor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have\nconducted _me_?'\n\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this\nrate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n\n'Hear me!' cried the Ghost. 'My time is nearly gone.'\n\n'I will,' said Scrooge. 'But don't be hard upon me! Don't be flowery,\nJacob! Pray!'\n\n'How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may\nnot tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.'\n\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the\nperspiration from his brow.\n\n'That is no light part of my penance,' pursued the Ghost. 'I am here\nto-night to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my\nfate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.'\n\n'You were always a good friend to me,' said Scrooge. 'Thankee!'\n\n'You will be haunted,' resumed the Ghost, 'by Three Spirits.'\n\nScrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done.\n\n'Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?' he demanded in a\nfaltering voice.\n\n'It is.'\n\n'I--I think I'd rather not,' said Scrooge.\n\n'Without their visits,' said the Ghost, 'you cannot hope to shun the\npath I tread. Expect the first to-morrow when the bell tolls One.'\n\n'Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?' hinted\nScrooge.\n\n'Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third, upon\nthe next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate.\nLook to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember\nwhat has passed between us!'\n\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the\ntable, and bound it round its head as before. Scrooge knew this by the\nsmart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the\nbandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural\nvisitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over\nand about its arm.\n\n\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and, at every step it took, the\nwindow raised itself a little, so that, when the spectre reached it, it\nwas wide open. It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they\nwere within two paces of each other, Marley's Ghost held up its hand,\nwarning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\n\nNot so much in obedience as\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_fe02daca35db7dd18f3e7a85d67d4aecd6854d70f30655c5aee5b9184cfe41d5_v2"}
